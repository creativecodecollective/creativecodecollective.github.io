    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p id="about">Creative Code Collective is a supportive community for critical and artistic coding. We support gaining programming skills in an engaging, non-intimidating environmentâ€”-instead focusing on project-driven approaches for learning and making with code. We emphasize criticality and experimentation, and we believe in growth not perfection, scrappy artistic strategies not perfect code, collaboration not competition. All levels and languages welcome!
