# CREATIVE.CODE.COLLECTIVE 

We believe in scrappy artistic strategies not perfect code, growth not perfection, collaboration and community, not competition. Join us in person, at USC's Media Arts + Practice division, or explore our growing online resource hub. 

You can find things to LEARN, DO, USE, and MAKE with code, as well as view projects created by our members.
