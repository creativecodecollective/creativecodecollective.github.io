## CREATIVE CODE COLLECTIVE

We believe in scrappy artistic strategies not perfect code, growth not perfection, collaboration and community, not competition. Join us in person, at USC's Media Arts + Practice division, or explore our growing resource hub online.

You can find things to LEARN, DO, USE, and MAKE with code, as well as view projects created by our members.

#### Meetups

Spring 2020: Mondays 1-4pm, SCI L106

#### Please Contribute

Please share your own resources with us if you want!

If you'd like to contribute, first let us know you want to join the Creative Code Collective. Then duplicate the `template.md` file in the `_resources` folder, rename it for your added resource, and fill in the template. Here's tips for formatting your resource in a [markdown file] and [clear commit].
