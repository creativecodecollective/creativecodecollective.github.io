# Contributing Guidelines

There are several ways you can be part of our community through contributing!

* Adding to the discussion: If you would like to contribute, the easiest way is to [create an issue] or look through existing items in our [issues], neither of which requires you to be a collaborator or fork the repository f.

* Working remotely: Through forks and pull requests, you can work on your own copy of the repository and push it upstream (i.e. back to this repository) whenever you want. Try this tutorial on [contributing to open-source projects](https://www.gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request) as a place to start on this.

* Working directly: If you would prefer to work directly on this repository, first let us know you want to join the Creative Code Collective. You can let us know in person, [create an issue], or contact us through another channel (we have a [Slack](https://mapcodecollective.slack.com) and an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/creativecodecollective/)). As a contributor, you can push directly to this repository.

## Find a typo?

Feel free to edit the file directly!

## Find a bug or want to add a new feature?

[Create an issue] to let everyone know about it. This will make sure there aren't multiple people working on the same thing. If you want to take a crack at it, specify that you're planning on working on it, and others will support you through fixing it if you need! If you'd prefer someone else to handle it, someone will be sure to take it up, or mark it for later.

## Want to add a resource?

Duplicate the [`template.md`](https://github.com/creativecodecollective/creativecodecollective.github.io/blob/master/template.md) file, rename it for your added resource, and fill in the template. Here's tips for formatting your resource in a [markdown file](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and how to write [clear commit comments](http://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages).

## Want to help develop visual styles?

You can either [create an issue](https://github.com/creativecodecollective/creativecodecollective.github.io/issues/new) with descriptions or images to showcase your vision, or edit layout and styles directly in the files.

## Not sure what to work on?

Check out our [issues] for some things that other people have marked for later and see if any of them catch your interest!
